        default FREERTOS_EXAMPLE_TASK
        help 
            Select which FreeRTOS feature demonstration to run.
            Only one feature can be active at a time.

        config FREERTOS_EXAMPLE_TASK
            bool "Basic led blinking"
            help
                Demonstrates basic FreeRTOS tasks with LED blinking.
                Uses two tasks with different blink rates.

        config FREERTOS_EXAMPLE_QUEUE
            bool "Queue Communication"
            help 
                Demonstrates inter-task communication using queues.
                One task sends data, another receives it.

        config FREERTOS_EXAMPLE_SEMAPHORE
            bool "Binary Semaphore communication"
            help 
                Demonstrates synchronization using binary semaphores.
                ADC task signals UART task when data is ready.
        
        config FREERTOS_EXAMPLE_MUTEX
            bool "Mutex (Priority Inheritance)"
            help
                Demonstrates mutex usage with priority inheritance.
                Shows how high priority tasks can inherit priority
                to prevent priority inversion.

        config FREERTOS_EXAMPLE_EVENT_GROUP
            bool "Event Groups"
            help
                Demonstrates event groups for synchronization.
                Processing task waits for multiple sensor events.
